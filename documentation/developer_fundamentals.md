# DEVELOPER FUNDAMENTALS

## 1. Don't read the dictionary.
You can always Google things. You don't need to memorize every function and bit of syntax. What matters more is familiarizing yourself with the way a language works and how to think computationally. Don't learn a language as if you are trying to ace a test, but learn how to use it.

## 2. Comment your code.
Comments tell the interpreter to skip over a section of text, rather than try to run it as code. In Python, comments are denoted with #. \
Guidelines: 
* Don't add unnecessary clutter.
* Keep comments concise.
* Comments should always add clarity.
* Can this comment be fixed with more readable code?

## 3. Understanding Data Structures
Some data structures make more sense in certain situations than others. A good programmer gets familiar with these situations so that they can use the best, most efficient data for a given situation.
* _Lists_ work well for data that needs to stay in order.
* _Dictionaries_ work well for data where order is not important, but where different values and data types work together.
