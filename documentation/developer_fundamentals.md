# DEVELOPER FUNDAMENTALS

## 1. Don't read the dictionary.
You can always Google things. You don't need to memorize every function and bit of syntax. What matters more is familiarizing yourself with the way a language works and how to think computationally. Don't learn a language as if you are trying to ace a test, but learn how to use it.

## 2. Comment your code.
Comments tell the interpreter to skip over a section of text, rather than try to run it as code. In Python, comments are denoted with #. \
Guidelines: 
* Don't add unnecessary clutter.
* Keep comments concise.
* Comments should always add clarity.
* Can this comment be fixed with more readable code?
