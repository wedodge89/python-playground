# Best Practices

## Variable names

### Use snake_case

### Start with lowercase letter or underscore
    Underscore represents a "private variable"
### Can contain letters, numbers, and/or underscores
    No special symbols like ! % # &, etc.
### Case sensitive
    variable =/= vArIaBlE
### Don't overwrite keywords
    Cannot have names like "print" or "type"

## Four Pillars of OOP
1. Encapsulation-binding data and functions together into an object. An object should function in a way that dictionaries can't.
2. Abstraction-Make only necessary information visible to users/program as appropriate. 
3. Inheritance-Allows new objects to receive attributes from parents.
4. Polymorphism-Object classes can share methods w/ same name, that serve different purposes
