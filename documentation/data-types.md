# Python Data Types

## Fundamental Data Types

**int**-Integer. Any whole number. Can be used in mathematical operations. (e.g. 3, 5, 8, 138)

**float**-Floating Point Number. A number with decimal values. Can also be used in mathematical operations. Takes up much more memory than *int*s. (e.g. 5.6, 0.00003, 9.09)

**str**-String. A collection of letters, numbers, symbols, emojis, etc. that is treated as a single unit of text, contained within either single or double quotation marks.

**bool**-Boolean. A true/false binary. Logical values often used for conditionals. 

**list**-List. Denoted by square brackets []. A list of like or unlike data. Basically equivalent to arrays in other programming languages.

**None**-None. Represents an absence of value, such as when a function does not return any data. Roughly equivalent to Null in other programming languages.
