# Data Types
## Fundamental Data Types
### **Integer**
_-int_: Any whole number. (e.g. 1, 4, 18)
### **Floating point number**
_-float_: A number with a decimal. Used when numbers need to be more precise than integers allow. (e.g. 1.6, 4.35, 6.00)
### **Boolean** 
_-bool_: A binary, true/false value.
### **String**
-_str_: A collection of one or more characters to be interpreted as a piece of text.
### **List**
_-list_: Similar to arrays in other programming languages. An ordered collection of data that may be of the same or different data types.
### **Tuple**
_-tuple-_: Similar to lists, but immutable. More predictable, but less flexible. Also slightly more performant.
### **Set**
_-set_: 
### **Dictionary**
_-dict-_: An object made up of unordered key/value pairs. Items within are accessed using the key, rather than an index.
### **Complex Number**
_-complex_: A number containing both real and imaginary parts.
### **None**
-_None_: A data type with "null" value.

## Classes
Custom types, as created by the user.

## Specialized Data Types
Not built into Python, but stored in packages, module, libraries. Like *extensions* of the language.
