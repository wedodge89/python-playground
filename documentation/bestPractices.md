# Best Practices

## Variable names

### Use snake_case

### Start with lowercase letter or underscore
    Underscore represents a "private variable"
### Can contain letters, numbers, and/or underscores
    No special symbols like ! % # &, etc.
### Case sensitive
    variable =/= vArIaBlE
### Don't overwrite keywords
    Cannot have names like "print" or "type"
